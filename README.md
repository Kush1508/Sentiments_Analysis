# Sentiments_Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) task used to determine the sentiment behind a piece of text. It classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into opinions, reviews, or social media posts.

## Objective
Analyze text data to classify sentiments.
Help businesses and organizations understand customer feedback, product reviews, or social media trends.

## Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and processes raw text data (removing stopwords, tokenization, etc.).
Model: Uses machine learning or deep learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or LSTM for sentiment classification.
Visualization: Provides visual representations of sentiment distribution (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).

## Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset consisting of text samples and corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). Common datasets include movie reviews, product reviews, or social media datasets like Twitter data.

## Results
The model achieves sentiment classification accuracy of approximately 96% on the test set.
